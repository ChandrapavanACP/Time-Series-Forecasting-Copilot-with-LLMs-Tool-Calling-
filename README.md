## Development Environment For The AI Bootcamp

I'll provide the actual versions of software that I am running in my environment. This is important because the software is constantly changing and you may run into issues if you are using a different version of the software.

``` bash
conda env export --no-builds > environment_ds4b_301p_dev_matt.yml
```
